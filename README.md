## Matthew Arendall
## Choose Correct Path Game

**Project Summary**
The program will prompt the user to choose a difficulty level and ask 
the user questions to move 'left', 'right', 'straight', 'back'.
The user will have to choose which direction to go until they finish the 
maze. The path will be built randomly each time using the red black tree
algorithm to give equal paths. There will also be a score associated
using a ratio of how many doors they had to go through compared to the shortest
path. The user will also have an option to quit or go back to the main
menu at any time.
